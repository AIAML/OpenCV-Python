# OpenCV for image processing Python
I this repository I have implemented plenty of useful methods for image processing using open-cv library.
## Adaptive thresholding
Adaptive thresholding is the method where the threshold value is calculated for smaller regions. This leads to different threshold values for different regions with respect to the change in lighting. 
## The Gaussian pyramid
The Gaussian pyramid provides a representation of the same image at multiple scales, using simple lowpass filtering and decimation techniques. The Laplacian pyramid provides a coarse representation of the image as well as a set of detail images (bandpass components) at different scales.
## morphological
In morphological processing of images, pixels are added or removed from the images. The structure and shape of the objects are analyzed so that they can be identified. The basic operations in this processing are binary convolution and correlation, that is based on logical operations rather than arithmetic operations.
