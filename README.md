# OpenCV for image processing Python
I this repository I have implemented plenty of useful methods for image processing using open-cv library.
## Adaptive thresholding
Adaptive thresholding is the method where the threshold value is calculated for smaller regions. This leads to different threshold values for different regions with respect to the change in lighting.
